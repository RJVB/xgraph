Essaie celui-la (l'adresse de base est http://www.fftw.org):

FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform 
(DFT) in one or more dimensions, of both real and complex data, and of 
arbitrary input size. We believe that FFTW, which is free software 
<faq/section1.html>, should become the FFT library of choice for most 
applications. Our benchmarks <http://www.fftw.org/benchfft/>, performed on 
on a variety of platforms, show that FFTW's performance is typically 
superior to that of other publicly available FFT software. Moreover, FFTW's 
performance is portable: the program will perform well on most 
architectures without modification.
It is difficult to summarize in a few words all the complexities that arise 
when testing many programs, and there is no "best" or "fastest" program. 
However, FFTW appears to be the fastest program most of the time, 
especially in the multi-dimensional and real-complex cases (Kasparov is the 
best chess player in the world even though he loses some games). Hence the 
name, "FFTW," which stands for the somewhat whimsical title of "Fastest 
Fourier Transform in the West." Please visit the benchFFT 
<http://www.fftw.org/benchfft/> home page for a more extensive survey of 
the results.
The FFTW package was developed at MIT <http://web.mit.edu> by ~Matteo Frigo 
<http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/athena/homepage.html> and Steven G. Johnson 
<http://web.mit.edu/stevenj/mosaic/steven.html>.
