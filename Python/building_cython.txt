Don't do
cimport xgraph
cimport ascanf

but just call whatever is needed.

From an xgraph python prompt/console, call

distutils.core.run_setup('setup.py', script_args=['build'] )


where setup.py contains something like

from distutils.core import setup
from distutils.extension import Extension
from Cython.Distutils import build_ext

setup(
    cmdclass = {'build_ext': build_ext},
    ext_modules = [Extension("lic_internal", ["lic_internal.pyx"])]
)
