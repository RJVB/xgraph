This is xgraph, the X11 plotting programme. Originally by David Harrison, further
development by R.J.V. Bertin (RJVB) into a data exploration/processing tool.
Currently known to work on Mac OS X 10.6, Linux 2.6 and Cygwin - which probably means
it'll run on anything "*n*xy" with an X11 server.

Please, have a look at the other README files, especially README.INSTALL that contains
detailed (I hope) instructions on building and installing. Sorry for the old-fashioned
manual way in which this must be done, but I myself prefer to work that way :)
Alternatively, if you have Linux running on (probably) at least a Pentium class processor,
try the xgraph binary that *may* be provided together with the source distribution.

This distribution changes often, whenever I find a bug, or need some new functionality.
I won't comment on which of the two occur more frequently :) The only trustworthy
indication of the version, revision etc. is the date of the distribution archive itself,
and of the files contained within. I don't have the habit of bothering with version
numbers, major, minor, and non-roman alphabet designations. You can consider the whole 
thing a beta release, if you wish. If you insist, I'd say this is version 2001, release
07, patchlevel 23 :)

I do bother about backward compatibility, though, so you will generally not have to worry
about your files no longer working, or having adverse side-effects like formatting your
CD-ROM drive. This concerns xgraph files, of course. I won't make any commitments concerning
the effects of reading files that were not meant to be read by XGraph!

Above, before and during it all, have fun using it. It has been and still is my programme
of choice for anything from quickly looking at data to complicated processing. I am not
a professional programmer (just a nearly full-time one :)), nor a computer scientist. The
original programme had many "hackery-kludgy" solutions for seemingly trivial problems like
determining the correct printing width of a string. I am improving on many of these, but in
many cases with a good solution of a similar nature (to stick with the example, those widths
are now determined by invoking gs [ghostscript] with the string in question... Yes, I know,
I could do these things with the T1lib, but see the TODOHIST file for some thoughts on that).

This programme is freeware. You may use it for your own use, (re)distribute it, etc, as
long as you keep the original copyright notice (from David Harrison) intact, as well
as my own.

If you find bugs, implement improvements or additional features (have a look at TODOHIST),
PLEASE let me know about them!
